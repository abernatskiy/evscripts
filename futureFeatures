AFPO experiment for run-based LPE normalization
Graphical tools
sqlalchemy-based results storage
qsub dummy
Submit jobs not at once, but as the other jobs are getting completed.
Preprocessing in the Helper:
	* transfer client compilation to Helper
Postprocessing in the Helper
Check if the custom wall clock time limit is less than the queue WCT limit and throw error before PBS does.
Continue a stalled experiment.
Cleaner make call at staticEvsDynamicCeExperiment._compileClient()
class for error- (and possibly also argument difference-) aware results

Require Experiment.grid to be an actual Grid, not optionally None: the special case treatment is killing the code. Note: run grep -r "grid is None" ./
Replace imp with importlib where possible
Random seed treatment
	* include option for hash-based randseeds ( useful note: hash(frozenset(my_dict.items())) )
At staticEvsDynamicCeHelper, do something about the client and server processes other than sleeping on them
