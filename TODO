Pause an experiment; continue an unfinished experiment.

Random seed treatment
	* include option for hash-based randseeds ( useful note: hash(frozenset(my_dict.items())) )
make sure that the processResults code is aware when it writes anything into the old results dir

Replace imp with importlib where possible (only when the decision to transition to python3.5+ is made)

Correct the situation where more workers are spawned than needed and as a result the exception
RuntimeError('Failed to submit job: qsub worked, but the job did not apper in queue within {} seconds'.format(pbsEnv.waitForTheScheduler))
is raised by experient.py (extra workers terminate before they appear in qstat)

Split processResults() into gatherResultsData() and plotResults() - those two things go separately too often.

Time multiplication and comparisons at tools. Also:

Check if the custom wall clock time limit is less than the queue WCT limit and throw error before PBS does

Time statistics, maybe a histogram

Separate "run" folder for workers' working directories - listing becomes too long. The job stdout/error
files can be moved there upon the completion by the master script.
